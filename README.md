# Password Checker
A Python project for verifying password strength and security. This tool helps users check the validity and robustness of their passwords against common best practices.

## Features
- Checks for minimum required password length
- Evaluates password complexity: uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols
- Identifies commonly used or weak passwords
- Provides feedback on how to improve password strength
- Simple CLI or API-based usage (customizable)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13

## How It Works
The password checker analyzes the input password based on several criteria:
- Length (e.g., 8+ characters recommended)
- Presence of uppercase and lowercase letters
- Inclusion of numbers and symbols
- Check against a list of common passwords

After running the check, the program provides feedback and suggestions for strengthening weak passwords.
